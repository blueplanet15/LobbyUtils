# LobbyUtils
"LobbyUtils" is a complete rework of my previous mod "DisconnectMod", which I coded myself this time.

# Function
When in a room (still need to add checks for), if you press all of your face controller buttons, it disconnects you from your current room. However, if you press all of your face buttons, as well as your grips and triggers, it should disconnect you and reconnect you to the room you were just in.
